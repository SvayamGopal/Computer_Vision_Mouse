# Computer_Vision_Mouse

This computer vision based mouse can control and command the cursor on a computer screen using a Web camera. In order to move the cursor on the screen the user simply uses a specific color (Red in this case) within the viewing area of the camera. The video generated by the camera is analyzed using computer vision techniques and the computer moves the cursor according to the color movements that the user makes. This computer vision based mouse also have a feature of Right-click and Left-click. For the left-click function, Green color has been used for Right-click function, Yellow color has been used. This means that if the user introduces either Green or Yellow color in the viewing area of the camera then the respective function gets execured.

In order to implement this program we need to have the following libraries installed:

1.Python3
2.pip
3.Opencv
4.Matplotlib
5.Numpy
6.pyautogui

The video transmitted by the web camera is analyzed image by image in real time. 
We use the method of detection and tracking approach which is based on motion analysis which can be achieved by using the techniques like edge detection and color analysis. We will achieve it with using the pyautogui library to move the mouse based on its colors.

Red - Cursor movement

Green - Left-Click

Blue - Rght-click
